# Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream.
# Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
#
# Your KthLargest class will have a constructor which accepts an integer k and an integer array nums,
# which contains initial elements from the stream. For each call to the method KthLargest.add,
# return the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

# kth largest refers to the item in the list which is the kth largest. For example if k = 2,
# you would want the 2nd largest item, if k = 10, you would want the 10th largest item
